### welcome to hell

Congratulations! You have found the worst Github account ever and have inadvertedly landed yourself in hell! I advise leaving NOW!

Just some stuff about me because I can't be bothered to talk about it face to face (because I'm a loser, duh.)

- Obsessed with Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst and other games nobody cares about
- I know a decent amount of Lua, Javascript, PHP, and Python. I also know a fair amount of C++ (though I would like to know more advanced techniques with it) and a hilariously low amount of C#.
- I want to learn more C++ alongside C# and potentially Java.
- Too much interest in 2000s MMO/Live game networking and general Game Design.
- Wants to make a 2D 1980s arcade-style game one day.
